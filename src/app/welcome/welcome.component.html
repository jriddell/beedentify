  <p>I(NNS)dentify is designed to help you identify or hone your skills for correctly identifying 
    invasive species garden or local environment. There's also some information about the plant
  species that they often get mixed up.</p>

  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Please click one or more images which match what you are currently seeing.<br/>
    You should select at least <strong>2</strong> images, and preferably <strong>3</strong> for better identification.
  </li>
  <li>As you select images, the <strong>Possible Matches</strong> section will update.</li>
  <li>Once <em>more than</em> <strong>50%</strong> of the images you have selected match for a particular plant,
  a <strong>popup</strong> with more information on that insect will appear.<br/>
  <em>(Alternatively, you can click on each plant name in the Possible Matches for more information, if you don't get
  an exact match after making several selections).</em></li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can turn on zooming for more detail, and filter various categories of image on and off.</p>
  <p><em>Note: The images have been chosen to closely match these plants. However, we would always recommend 
    consulting with an expert, especially before undertaking any work to remove or control a plant.</em></p>
