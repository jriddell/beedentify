        has a preference for woodlands that consist of oak, ash, beech, elm and mixed broadleaf woodlands. It can also be found along
        old hedgerows and in some scrub lands. If conditions suit it, then a plant can spread by around 1m a year.</p>

      <p>Fun Facts: All parts of this plant are toxic, with the chemical mercurialine trimethylamine present throughout all its tissues.

      which contain a pale spotty landing strip for pollinators such as Bumblebees.</p>

      <p>Habitat: A plant that thrives on an acidic soil. I tis commonly found under headgerows, woodland edges, road verges
      and occasioanly muirs.</p>

      <p>Basic Facts: With smooth, green stems, sometimes with a reddish tinge. These plants can grow up to 2.5m in hieght, being narrow
        in their growing habit. The leaves grow in spiral formation aorund the stem, the leaves themselves are smooth, no wider than a 4cm
        and long, like that of a willow. When in flower, the top 40cm to 1m of the plant can be lined with an oppposite arrangement of
        magenta to light pink flowers. These flowers are usually 2-3cm in diameter, have four petals exclusing four sepals behind these,
        and a protruding stamen.</p>

      <p>Habitat: It likes all pH of soils, and is an early coloniser of distrubed or burnt soils. It often likes a damp soil, but is
        very adaptable and is often found in many locations such as wetland edge, road verges, waste piles and on newly formed or
        flooded river banks or barrs.</p>

      <p>Fun Facts: The plant was long misindetified as its cousing the Hairy Willowherb and so was thought to be rare throughout the UK.
        However, it experienced a dramatic range expansion in the UK due to its habit or rapidly colonising bomb sites in and post WW2. As
        such it became commonly know as bombweed.</p>
