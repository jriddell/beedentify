<h1>Solitary Bees</h1>

<p>There are many species of these insects which occur frequently around our homes and gardens in spring and summer.
They are all beneficial to the environment and pose no threat to humans.</p>

<p>Most species lay eggs either in holes in the ground, earth banks, or stonework/masonry. They look very similar to honey bees,
  though they lack the pollen baskets on their hind legs.  They are also generally only present in spring and early summer,
  and die off after laying their eggs - the larvae of which will emerge in the following spring.</p>
