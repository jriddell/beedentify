<h1>Wasps</h1>

<p>Wasps are smooth-shelled and shiny, with brighter, distinct yellow and black stripes, and lack the hairs that honey bees and bumble bees have.
They are more inquisitive and aggressive than bees, and are attracted to sweet smelling or fermenting things, such as jam, rotten fruit, alcohol.

<p>Wasps can sting repeatedly, and are much more likely to do so than honey or bumble bees - especially later on in the season.</p>

<p>If you have an issue with wasps, then you should contact a pest control company who will be able to remove them.</p>
