<h1>Honey Bees</h1>

<p>Honey bees are small, slightly hairy, and muted in colour - usually shades of brown and black, rather than the bright yellow of wasps or hornets.
They are only usually aggressive when defending their hive, and are not aggressive like wasps when foraging away from home.
Honey bees can often be seen carrying pollen on their hind legs as 'pollen baskets'.</p>

<h2>Swarms</h2>

<p>The commonest reason to need assistance with honey bees is when they swarm.</p>

<p>Swarming usually occurs in late spring and summer when the queen leaves the hive or nest with all
the the adult flying bees leaving behind enough young bees, larvae, eggs and prepared queen cells to keep the colony going.
This is the natural way in which honey bees increase their numbers.</p>

<p>A swarm will travel to a new location and may land on trees, bushes, walls, posts or anything convenient to wait while the scouts
find a new permanent home. A swarm can be an unwelcome guest when this happens.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Swarms</h2>
<p>Swarms are large, noisy balls of bees, and on first sight can seem quite frightening! However, swarms are generally peaceful,
and provided they are not disturbed, will generally ignore the presence of people until they settle in a new permanent home, where they will resume guard duties.</p>

<p>If you encounter a swarm, you should take the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep any people, children and pets or other animals away from the swarm.</li>
  <li>If possible, alert passers-by to the presence of the swarm so that they don't accidentally disturb it.</li>
  <li>Don't do anything to provoke or disturb the swarm to try to get it to move on. The swarm will only move when it is ready to do so, and interference might result in stings!</li>
  <li>If you need to move around near the swarm, do so in a calm, controlled manner, avoiding making any sudden movements or loud noises.</li>
  <li>Get in touch with a beekeeper to remove the swarm.</li>
</ul>
