<h1>Hornets</h1>

<p>Hornets are similar to wasps - they build nests out of paper and plant materials.
However they are less common than wasps, and generally less agressive - even though they are
often much larger!</p>

<p>Like wasps, if you have a problem with hornets, then the best option is to contact
  a pest control company to remove them. Hornets, though less likely to sting, do deliver
  a much more painful sting than wasps, so DIY methods or removal are best avoided!</p>

<p>There is also currently a threat from the Asian Hornet, which was accidentally introduced
  into France, and is at risk of entering the UK. If this species is seen, it should be reported
  <a href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/factsheet/factsheet.cfm?speciesId=3826">Asian Hornet Reporting</a></p>
