<h1>Bumblebees</h1>

<p>Bumblebees are generally large, round and visibly furry, and come in a variety of species and colours.
They are fairly common in gardens throughout the UK during the spring and summer, and often build nests in compost heaps,
under decking or gardens shed and other warm dry places like old mouse nests.</p>

<p>They are generally peaceful, and while they can sting rarely do so unless their
nest is disturbed. However the Tree Bumble Bee - a relatively new species to the UK, can be more defensive.
It's preferred nesting site is in bird boxes or roof eaves.</p>

<p>umblebees are one of our wild insects that occur naturally throughout the country and are hugely important pollinators.
Unfortunately, due to loss of habitat and the prevalence of pesticide use, their numbers are decreasing and some species
are already under severe threat of extinction.</p>

<p>Bumble bees only nest in a location for a single season, so the nest will be
abandoned by winter - so in most cases they can just be left where they are for the summer.  Otherwise, if you need to move
them the only option is to use a pest control company - beekeepers aren't able to help with Bumblebees.</p>
