<h1>Insect Identification</h1>

<h2>Walls</h2>

<p><a href="honeybees.html">Honey Bees</a>, <a href="bumblebees.html">Bumble Bees</a>, <a href="wasps.html">Wasps</a>, and <a href="solitarybees.html">Solitary Bees</a> can all be found nesting in walls, vents or similar cavities.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to get close enough to safely identify which type of insect is using the hole, then a few other questions can be asked?</p>

<h3>How big is the space behind the entrance hole?</h3>

<p>Bumble bees and solitary bees only build very small nests. If the space behind the hole is only perhaps the size of a mug or large jar, then it is most likely to be one of these insects.</p>

<p>Honey bees tend to prefer larger spaces to build their nests - a 2 or 3 foot cube is ideal, or even larger. If you have cavity wall spaces, or the wall sits in front of a large space, such as an attic, then it could be honey bees.</p>

<h3>How many insects can I see coming in and out of the hole?</h3>

<p>Bumble bees and solitary bees build small nests, and have small populations.  You usually don't see more than 1 or 2 bees at a time, coming or going from their nest, and not many bees clustered around the entrance.</p>

<p>Honey bees can build very large nests, housing thousands of bees. You usually see many bees coming and going at the entrance at once, and others hanging around the entrance.</p>

<h3>Is there one entrance, or multiple entrances close together?</h3>

<p>Bumble bees and solitary bees often have multiple points of access to their nests, or there are several separate colonies in adjacent spaces in the wall. Thus you often see bees coming and going from several separate holes on the wall.</p>

<p>Honey bees prefer to only have a single entrance - you might see lots of bees crowded around that entrance, but there will not be several spread out across the wall.</p>
